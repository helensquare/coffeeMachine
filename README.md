# coffeeMachine â˜•

As part of my Python learning journey, I created the code for a coffee machine.

## Choosing the drink

This machine asks the user to choose between 3 drinks: espresso, latte and cappuccino. 

The machine also accepts 2 secret words: "off" to turn the machine off and "report", to print out the amount of resources (water, milk and coffee) left in the machine and the money collected so far.

## Check resources

Once the clien has chosen the drink they want, the machine will first check if there are enough resources available in the machine.
If so, it will continue to prepare the drink. 
If not, it will print which ingredient is missing.

## Asking for money

Once the machine has checked there are enough resources for the drink, it asks the client to insert the money.

It checks it the amount of money inserted is enough for the drink. If so, it will return the change to the user (if applicable) and add the profit to the report.

If not, it will tell the client that the money inserted is not sufficient.

## Preparing the drink

As a final step, the machine will prepare the drink. It will reduce the amount of ingredients used from the resources and will show it in the next report. 


Enjoy your drinks!
